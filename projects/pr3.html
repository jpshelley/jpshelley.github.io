			<h2>4 Years</h2>
			<h4 class="margin">Development/Design - Web</h4>
			<p>4Years was a web app built mostly in php with an sqllite database. It was the dedicated project
that I had the privilege of being the team manager for during Software Engineering 339 taught by
Professor Weiss. 4Years was supposed to not only help you plan out your 4 college years but be
more of a central hub of class dedication. Its intentions were to connect with your friends and
show you what classes they were in, as well as bring up specific information of each individual
class so you donâ€™t have to search for it either.</p>
