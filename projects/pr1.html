			<h2>CyPlanner</h2>
			<h4 class="margin">Development - Android</h4>
			<p>CyPlanner was an Android application built for Computer Science 319 taught by Professor Basu.
CyPlanner was intended to be a freshmans focal point during their college experience, including
a dedicated class list, including a map of how to get to each class.
Due to the loss of two team members the project only got as far as a list of classes, with the
ability to add and remove, and locate them on a campus map.
