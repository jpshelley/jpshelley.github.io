			<h2>Jarvis</h2>
			<h4 class="margin">Development - Objective-C</h4>
			<p>Jarvis was an implementation taken from Tony Stark, aka Iron Man. Jarvis in its natural scense, is a personal assistant with artificial intelligence. Jarvis in the comic and theatrical form can complete any command that its creator gives it. It is capable of learning and adheres to the users personality. My current implementation is a work in progress but takes basic commands and completes them. Hopefully soon I will be able to implement the capabilities of learning. </p>
